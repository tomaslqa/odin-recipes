        <li>50 ml of warm milk</li>
        <li>500 g flour</li>

    <h4>Steps:</h4>

        <li>Crumble fresh yeast into a bowl with warm milk and add sugar.
            Stir to dissolve the yeast, then leave for about 15 min aside.</li>
        <li>After 15 minutes, put the flour in a large bowl, pour the risen yeast, milk, yogurt, egg and salt.</li>
        <li>Knead a smooth dough.</li>
        <li>Cover the container with transparent foil and leave the dough in a warm place for at least half an hour, preferably 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the surface on which we will roll out the dough with flour.</li>
        <li>Spread part of the risen dough on the surface and roll it out to a thickness of half a centimeter.</li>
        <li>Use a knife to cut squares and triangles measuring 10x5 centimeters and cut a slit in the middle of each rectangle.</li>
        <li>Leave the dough to rest for another 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>pour a large amount of oil (1 liter) into the pan on the fire and heat it to 170 degrees.</li>
        <li>Carefully put the dough in it and fry on both sides for a short time, until golden-yellow.</li>
        <li>Place fried pastry on kitchen paper to absorb excess fat.</li>
